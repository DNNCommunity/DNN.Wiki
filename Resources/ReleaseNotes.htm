    </p>

    <h4>Bug Fixes</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Question Marks in the title create uneditable pages</li>
        <li>RSS Feed - Doesn't refer to the topic address</li>
        <li>Add Delete Confirmation</li>

    </ul>
    <h4>Enhancements</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>The "index" is no longer on the left in the menu, it is now "show all pages" and takes you to another page that lists off all pages. </li>
        <li>the left menu is no longer being built in a table, it should allow you to customize things better with CSS now, though I believe it will still display like it used to until you customize the CSS (that was the goal)</li>
        <li>Lots of code refactoring, moving things around, trying to streamline the code to make it easier to add enhancements. Let me know if you run into anything that doesn't work.</li>
        <li>Moved the Edit/Add/ViewHistory links out into a separate control that allows for display in other situations.</li>
